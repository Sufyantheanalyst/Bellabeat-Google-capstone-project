# How Can a Wellness Technology Company Play It Smart?
In this context, we are part of the marketing analyst team employed by Bellabeat, a cutting-edge manufacturer specializing in health-oriented products designed for women. Ur코ka Sr코en, one of the co-founders and the Chief Creative Officer at Bellabeat, is of the opinion that delving into the analysis of fitness data from smart devices has the potential to reveal fresh avenues for growth and expansion for the company.
# Regarding the company:
Bellabeat was established by Ur코ka Sr코en and Sando Mur as a forward-thinking enterprise specializing in the creation of cutting-edge smart products with a strong emphasis on health and wellness. Leveraging Sr코en's artistic background, the company has developed technology that not only boasts exceptional design but also serves as a source of information and inspiration for women across the globe. Through the collection of data pertaining to physical activity, sleep patterns, stress levels, and reproductive health, Bellabeat has empowered women by providing valuable insights into their own well-being and daily routines. Since its inception in 2013, Bellabeat has experienced rapid growth and has rapidly positioned itself as a technology-driven wellness enterprise tailored to the needs of women.

By 2016, Bellabeat had expanded its presence globally, establishing offices in various locations and introducing a range of new products. These Bellabeat products were made accessible through an increasing number of online retailers, complementing the company's own e-commerce platform on its website. While Bellabeat has made investments in traditional advertising avenues, including radio, out-of-home billboards, print media, and television, it places a strong emphasis on digital marketing. The company maintains an ongoing presence on Google Search, actively engages with audiences on Facebook and Instagram, and consistently interacts with consumers on Twitter. Additionally, Bellabeat runs video advertisements on YouTube and employs display ads on the Google Display Network to support marketing campaigns centered around key milestones.

Recognizing that a thorough analysis of the consumer data at their disposal could uncover additional growth opportunities, Sr코en has tasked the marketing analytics team with a specific mission. The team is to focus on a Bellabeat product and examine the usage data of smart devices to gain deeper insights into how people are currently utilizing these devices. With this information in hand, she seeks high-level recommendations on how these emerging trends can shape and enhance Bellabeat's marketing strategy moving forward.

# 游눹Data preparation:
Obtaining the Data

In order to address our primary question, which pertains to how current user behaviors can inform our marketing strategy, we will be utilizing data sourced from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit). This dataset, available on Kaggle, comprises personal fitness tracker data contributed by thirty-three Fitbit users who met the criteria for eligibility and provided their consent for the submission of personal tracker data. The dataset encompasses minute-level details regarding physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Within it, you can find information regarding daily activity, step counts, and heart rate measurements, all of which can be harnessed to gain insights into user behavior.

Contained within the 'fitbit' directory is a subfolder titled 'Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16,' housing a collection of 18 CSV files, each of which contains tracker data, including minute-by-minute records of physical activity, heart rate data, and sleep monitoring statistics.

To facilitate the process of file access, we can create a path variable to store the directory path that holds all the CSV files.
```python
 df14 = pd.read_csv('dailyActivity_merged.csv') 
```
