# 游눹Data preparation:
Obtaining the Data

In order to address our primary question, which pertains to how current user behaviors can inform our marketing strategy, we will be utilizing data sourced from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit). This dataset, available on Kaggle, comprises personal fitness tracker data contributed by thirty-three Fitbit users who met the criteria for eligibility and provided their consent for the submission of personal tracker data. The dataset encompasses minute-level details regarding physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Within it, you can find information regarding daily activity, step counts, and heart rate measurements, all of which can be harnessed to gain insights into user behavior.

Contained within the 'fitbit' directory is a subfolder titled 'Fitabase Data 4.12.16-5.12.16,' housing a collection of 18 CSV files, each of which contains tracker data, including minute-by-minute records of physical activity, heart rate data, and sleep monitoring statistics.

# We are using Python for data cleaning, transformation and visualisation

To facilitate the process of file access, we can create a path variable to store the directory path that holds all the CSV files.
```python
 df14 = pd.read_csv('dailyActivity_merged.csv') 
```
# 游빓Process
In this phase, our focus will be on data processing, which involves tasks such as cleaning and ensuring its accuracy, relevance, completeness, and freedom from errors and outliers. This will be achieved through the following steps:

# Data Exploration and Observation: 
We will carefully examine the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of its characteristics and content.

# Identification and Handling of Missing or Null Values: 
We will identify any missing or null values within the data and take appropriate measures to address them.

# Data Transformation: 
To ensure consistency, we will consider data type formatting and make any necessary adjustments.

# Preliminary Statistical Analysis: 
We will conduct an initial round of statistical analysis to uncover key insights and trends within the data.

The objective of these processes is to prepare the data for further analysis and ensure its quality and integrity.
```python
# import packages and alias
import numpy as np # data arrays
import pandas as pd # data structure and data analysis
import matplotlib as plt # data visualization
import datetime as dt # date time
```
```python
# importing dataframe 
df14 = pd.read_csv('dailyActivity_merged.csv')
```
# Data cleaning & manipulation

Gathering Fundamental Data Information:

Total number of rows and columns.
Names of the columns.
Count of non-null values.
Data types of the columns.

```python
# review first 20 rows to get an idea about columns and data
df14.head(20)
```
![image](https://github.com/Sufyantheanalyst/Bellabeat-Google-capstone-project/assets/129004768/821e8aa4-21df-4ada-a782-030f7d3503bd)

```python

```python
# to check the number of rows and columns 
df14.shape
```

```python
df14.size
```
![image](https://github.com/Sufyantheanalyst/Bellabeat-Google-capstone-project/assets/129004768/a4d9afd3-e6d0-44ae-820a-224c4e465c07)

```python
#  resetting the index of the DataFrame while dropping the previous index
df14.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)
```
```python
df14.head(5)
```
```python
# rename the dataframe
daily_activity = df14
```
```python
daily_activity.head(5)
```
Next, I will determine if there are any null or missing values within the dataset.
```python
# counting the missing values in dataframe
count_missing_values = daily_activity.isnull().sum()
```
```python
count_missing_values[:]
```
![image](https://github.com/Sufyantheanalyst/Bellabeat-Google-capstone-project/assets/129004768/2a5fc810-32d3-46b2-8767-1229ca02b50c)

```python
daily_activity.info()        # ActivityDate column is object dtype
```

Now that we've identified the data requiring refinement, our next step is to engage in data manipulation and transformation. This will involve the following operations:

Converting the "ActivityDate" to the "datetime64" data type.
Formatting the "ActivityDate" to the "yyyy-mm-dd" format.
Generating a new column named "DayOfTheWeek" by deriving the date as the corresponding day of the week for future analysis.
Establishing a new column titled "TotalMins" by aggregating the values from "VeryActiveMinutes," "FairlyActiveMinutes," "LightlyActiveMinutes," and "SedentaryMinutes."
Creating an additional column, "TotalHours," by converting the "TotalMins" column (mentioned in step 4) to hours.
Reordering and renaming columns to enhance clarity and organization.
To commence this process, we will initially convert the "ActivityDate" from an "object" data type to "datetime64," followed by the objective of formatting "ActivityDate" in the "yyyy-mm-dd" style.
```python
# converting ActivityDate object type to datetime type
daily_activity["ActivityDate"] = pd.to_datetime(df14["ActivityDate"])
```
```python
daily_activity.info()
```

```python
print(daily_activity["ActivityDate"].dtype)
```
![image](https://github.com/Sufyantheanalyst/Bellabeat-Google-capstone-project/assets/129004768/e59862a0-3530-4277-bc9d-16d6a5c06c62)

```python
# Converting format of ActivityDate to yyyy-mm-dd
daily_activity["ActivityDate"] = daily_activity["ActivityDate"].dt.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
```
```python
print(daily_activity["ActivityDate"])
```

```python
# creating new list of columns to rearrange the columns
new_columns = ['Id', 'ActivityDate', 'DayOfTheWeek', 'TotalSteps', 'TotalDistance', 'TrackerDistance', 'LoggedActivitiesDistance', 'VeryActiveDistance', 'ModeratelyActiveDistance', 'LightActiveDistance', 'SedentaryActiveDistance', 'VeryActiveMinutes', 'FairlyActiveMinutes', 'LightlyActiveMinutes', 'SedentaryMinutes', 'TotalExerciseMinutes', 'TotalExerciseHours', 'Calories']

# reindex function to rearrange columns based on "new_columns"
daily_activity = df14.reindex(columns=new_columns)
```
Creating new column by separating the date into day of the week for further analysis.
```python
# Creating new column by separating the date into day of the week for further analysis
daily_activity['DayOfTheWeek'] = daily_activity['ActivityDate'].dt.day_name()
```
```python
# to check the new added column
print(daily_activity)
```

Creating new column total_mins being the sum of total time logged.
```python
# creating new column total_mins by adding all minutes of all catagaries
daily_activity["total_mins"] = daily_activity["VeryActiveMinutes"] + daily_activity["FairlyActiveMinutes"] + daily_activity["LightlyActiveMinutes"] + daily_activity["SedentaryMinutes"]

```python
# creting a new column total_hours by converting total minutes into hours
daily_activity["total_hours"] = round(daily_activity["total_mins"] / 60)
```
```python
daily_activity["total_hours"].head(5)
```

# STEP 5: SHARE
In this step, we are creating visualizations and communicating our findings based on our analysis.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
days_of_week = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday', 'Sunday']
frequency = [10, 15, 8, 12, 20, 18, 14]

# Create a bar plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.bar(days_of_week, frequency, color="green", edgecolor="black")

# Adding annotations and visuals
plt.xlabel("Day of the week")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("No. of times users logged in app across the week")

# Display the plot
plt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotate x-axis labels for better readability
plt.grid(axis='y', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Usage Frequency Throughout the Week

Within this histogram, we examine the usage frequency of the FitBit app, categorized by days of the week.

Our findings reveal that users tend to have a preference for or recollection of (with consideration for the possibility of occasional lapses) tracking their activity on the app primarily during the middle of the week, spanning from Tuesday through Friday. It is worth noting that usage frequency experiences a decline on Fridays and persists at lower levels over the weekend and on Mondays.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.hist(daily_activity['very_active_mins'], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Very Active Minutes')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Very Active Minutes')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.hist(daily_activity['fairly_active_mins'], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Fairly Active Minutes')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Very Fairly Minutes')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.hist(daily_activity['lightly_active_mins'], bins=20, color='skyblue', edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Lightly Active Minutes')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Distribution of Lightly Active Minutes')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
![image](https://github.com/Sufyantheanalyst/Bellabeat-Google-capstone-project/assets/129004768/d878073b-f294-4d89-97e8-6e727d86eb3f)
These plots reveal that a significant number of users, exceeding 400 individuals, allocate minimal time to being Very or Fairly Active. In contrast, the distribution of LightlyActiveMinutes displays a noteworthy degree of symmetry, with the exception of instances of exceptionally low minute counts.

Nevertheless, an issue warrants consideration: it remains uncertain whether all users consistently utilized the tracker throughout the entire day within the analyzed timeframe. In the event that a user records data for the entire day, the sum of VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes, and SedentaryMinutes should equate to 1440, representing the total number of minutes in a day.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(daily_activity['total_steps'], daily_activity['calories'], alpha=0.6, c='blue', edgecolor='black')
plt.xlabel('Total Steps')

Percentage Breakdown of Activity Duration

As illustrated in the pie chart,

The largest portion, accounting for 81.3%, is attributed to Sedentary minutes. This suggests that users primarily utilize the FitBit app for recording daily activities such as commuting, sedentary movements (shifting from one location to another), or completing routine errands.

The usage of the app for tracking fitness activities (e.g., running) is infrequent, as evidenced by the minimal percentages for fairly active activity (1.1%) and very active activity (1.7%). This observation is somewhat disheartening considering that the FitBit app was originally designed to promote physical fitness.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns  # Import Seaborn
import numpy as np


fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 4, figsize=(15, 5), sharey=True)
fig.suptitle('Distance per Minutes of Activity')

sns.regplot(data = daily_activity, x = 'very_active_mins', y = 'very_active_dist', ax=axes[0])
axes[0].set_xlim([0,500])
sns.regplot(data = daily_activity, x = 'fairly_active_mins', y = 'moderate_active_dist', ax=axes[1])
axes[1].set_xlim([0,500])
sns.regplot(data = daily_activity, x = 'lightly_active_mins', y = 'light_active_dist', ax=axes[2])
axes[2].set_xlim([0,500])
sns.regplot(data = daily_activity, x = 'sedentary_mins', y = 'sedentary_active_dist', ax=axes[3])
axes[3].set_xlim([0,500]);
```

As anticipated, VeryActive distances are covered in shorter durations, as indicated by their steeper regression lines, signifying higher speeds. FairlyActiveMinutes and LightlyActiveMinutes also exhibit variations in speed. It would be intriguing to gain insight into the criteria used for this categorization to better discern the distinctions between "Light" and "Moderate" activities.

# STEP 6: Act

In the final stage, we will present our findings and offer recommendations based on our analysis. During this phase, we will revisit our initial business inquiries and share high-level business suggestions.

Identification of Trends:
The majority of users (81.3%) primarily employ the FitBit app for monitoring sedentary activities, with a relatively limited focus on health habit tracking.
Users exhibit a preference for tracking their activities during weekdays, potentially influenced by increased outdoor activities during this period compared to weekends.

Application of These Trends to Bellabeat Customers:
Both companies, Bellabeat and FitBit, share a common mission of empowering women with insights into their health, habits, and fitness data. These prevalent trends in the health and fitness domain can be directly applicable to Bellabeat's customer base.

Utilizing These Trends for Bellabeat's Marketing Strategy:
The Bellabeat marketing team can encourage users by providing valuable education and equipping them with information about the benefits of fitness. They can suggest various exercise routines, such as simple 10-minute workouts on weekdays and more intensive workouts on weekends. Additionally, offering information on calorie intake and expenditure within the Bellabeat app can further enhance user engagement.

During weekends, the Bellabeat app can strategically send notifications to motivate users to engage in physical activities, fostering a healthier lifestyle.
